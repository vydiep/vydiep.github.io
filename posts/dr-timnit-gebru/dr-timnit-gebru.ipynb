    "On Monday, April 24, from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm, Dr. Timnit Gebru will be giving a virtual talk on bias and social impacts of artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gebru is a prominent computer scientist and a leading voice in the field of artificial intelligence ethics. She is widely recognized for her advocacy for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, particularly in regards to underrepresented groups such as women and people of color. She is the co-founder of Black in AI, a community of black researchers working in artificial intelligence. She is also the founder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (dair), which is expected to document the effect of artifical intelligence on marginalized groups, with a focus on Africa and African immigrants in the United States. She was named one of the world's 50 greatest leaders by Fortune, one of Nature's ten people who shaped science in 2021, and one of Time's most influential people in 2022."

    "# Dr. Gebru's Talk\n",
    "\n",
    "In her talk at the conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recogition 2020 as part of a Tutorial on Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) in Computer Vision, Dr. Gebru provided an overview of the key issues and challenges in developing ethical and fair computer vision systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "She highlighted the ways in chich bias and discrimination can be embedded in the data used to train these systems, as well as the algorithms and models themselves. For example, she noted that if a training data set contains imbalances in representation across different groups, then the resulting model may be diased towards those groupds that are overrepresented in the data. This can lead to unfair outcomes, such as misclassification or exclusion of certain individuals or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gebru suggested several approaches for ensuring fairness in computer vision systems, such as using representative data sets, measuring and mitigating bias in algorithms and models, and evaluating these systems on multiple fairness metrics, as different metrics may be more relevant to different applications or contexts. She emphasized the need for greater transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of computer vision systems, especially in high-stakes applications such as criminal justice and healthcare. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key takeaway from her talk is that computer vision, as used today, aren't a neutral or objective technology. These systems can have significant impacts on individuals or society as a whole, particularly in areas such as criminal justice, healthcare, and employment."

    "# Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A question for Dr. Gebru is, what steps do you believe are necessary to ensure that the development and deployment of AI systems are guided by ethical principles, and how can these principles be integrated into the broader tech industry culture especially when those who've spoken out about these problems have been \"punished\" by big tech corporations?
